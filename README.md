# Introduction
This After-Action Report presentation deck was created as an informational tool to inform fellow employees of this company tradition of Cast Member canoe racing, which is seen as a moral boosting and team building event. These canoe races have been going on for almost the same amount of time, the Disneyland theme park has been open.  This was the second year of the Cast Member canoe races since Disneyland reopened from covid closure.

This repository displays an after-action report that was created in my day job as a Reporting Associate for The Disneyland Resort. <B>The data set used for this repository is seen as public data of canoe race times taken at The Disneyland Resort. This data was deemed non-sensitive due to not containing any information about the resort.</B> This was created to inform fellow employees who were not familiar with these canoe races and their history.


# Abstract
Every year Cast Members from the west coast theme parks to the studios participate in friendly canoe races from June to August at the rivers of America in Disneyland. These canoes races start with time trails and qualifying teams are placed in four divisions. These teams race each other to be winners of their division, which leads them to race for the fast time on the river. There is no prize, other than the right to boast about being the winners of the canoe races. The Guest Communication Reporting team was tasked to report on the race times, division winners and the winner of the Cast Member canoe races to employees who have not heard of these races. 


# Summary of Skills
Microsoft Excel was used to collect and analyze the publicly available race time data. Power Point was also used to create the presentation deck, which includes actual canoe race photos and logos.

This is a preview of the Canoe Races Presentation.


# Findings
After analyzing the race times of each division, I did see one division had a clear winner from the beginning. In other divisions, the teams battled with each other to become the division winner.  I also saw several teams drop out either in the beginning of the canoe races or during the quarter finals. I also noticed that each division correlated to the skill level of the teams. The fastest teams were placed in one division and depending on the skill level and race times, each team was placed in a related division.



# Challenges
The challenge for this presentation deck was the direction of the storytelling for the canoe races. On the surface, it appears to straight forward of informing the reader of the top race times and division progress. The presentation deck also needs to inform the reader about the teams that started in the division and which teams were eliminated.


# Conclusion
The focus of this presentation deck was to inform employees of the Disneyland Resort who aren’t familiar with Cast Member canoe races. This was the second year of canoe races since Disneyland reopened from covid closure. Since reopening, there have been new employees who don’t know of many Disneyland traditions and team building events. This was created to inform the reader in a streamlined manner that quickly tells you about the winners for the races within the four divisions the progress they made to reach it.
